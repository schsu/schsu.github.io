## About Me

I am working on experimental particle physics using proton-proton collision data from the Large Hadron Collider as a member in the UW Elementary Particle Experiment Group. My research interests range from dark matter searches with the ATLAS experiment, neutrino cross-section measurement with the FASER experiment, and innovative Artificial Intelligence algorithms for data-intensive discovery. My team collaborates with Prof. Scott Hauck's ACME Lab to work on the ATLAS Pixel operation, the ATLAS Inner Tracker Pixel upgrade, and accelerated machine learning with heterogeneous computing. In addition, I led physics outreach events to promote STEM education.
